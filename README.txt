# Project overview #
####################

The following files are associated with the project "A global meta-analysis of temperature effects on 
marine fishesâ€™ digestion across trophic groups" and are intended to allow any interested parties to 
access the data and code used to produce the analyses in that paper.

All data files are accessible through Dryad.
All data files, analysis files and .rds files are accessible through Github at https://github.com/nicoleknight0/meta-analysis-fish-digestion

##################
# Analysis files #
##################

### data_analysis.R
-R script that provides code that can be used to reproduce all final models, 
analyses, figures and tables in the published main text and Appendix 2.  

### sessionInfo.txt
-Text file that provides R version and package versions used to conduct the final models and analyses

##############
# .rds files # 
##############

All .rds files are records of the models generated from the data_analysis.R script using set.seed(438).
Parameter estimates used in the figures and tables included in the main text and Appendix 2 were 
extracted from models built with that specific set.seed() and run in the same order as presented in the
script.  Running the models without set.seed(438) may slightly change parameter estimates.

### data_absorption_efficiency.csv

-This file contains all estimates of marine fishes' absorption efficiency and ancillary data taken from the literature
that were used in our analyses.

### data_gut_length.csv

-This file contains all estimates of marine fishes' gut length and ancillary data taken from the literature that 
were used in our analyses.

### data_gut_passage.csv

-This file contains all estimates of marine fishes' gut passage time and ancillary data taken from the literature that 
were used in our analyses.

### data_nutrients.csv

-This file contains all estimates of the nutrient concentrations of food fed to fishes in studies 
included in our other analyses and ancillary data. 

### model_weights.csv

-This file contains a record of all model weights used to calculate the average and standard deviations
of the model weights reported in the main text and Appendix 2.

#Specific to data_absorption_efficiency.csv

method -> for absorption efficiency, marker method or total collection method (see Appendix S2 of publication)

absorption.efficiency -> proportion of component absorbed (0 = none of the component absorbed, 1 = all of the component absorbed)

#Specific to data_gut_length.csv

preferred -> for species with multiple gut length reports, poorer-quality reports (e.g., did not report temperature) or reports of intestine-only length were excluded (coded N) and the script randomly selects from the remaining reports (coded Y)
type -> did the authors measure only the intestine or the entire gut
diet.reference -> if the species' diet classification was not reported in the original study, the study from which we collected its diet classification
sample.period -> the period over which fish were collected for gut length analysis
gutlength.mean.mm -> average gut length in millimeters
ln.gutlength.mean -> natural logarithm of gut length
gutlength.sd -> standard deviation of gut length
relativelength.min -> minimum reported (gut length) / (body length)
relativelength.max -> maximum reported (gut length) / (body length)
